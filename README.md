# Building of conversational agents using goal-oriented dialog managers (Konversa)

## Brief Overview
<div style="text-align: right"> The call centers require automation for customer services to provide cost-efficient, reliable, and user-friendly self-services for domain-specific tasks in an interactive manner. Human-Human conversations are a reliable source to build conversational agents to generate natural responses with proper greetings to satisfy the customers. Several components have trained separately to interpret the user’s intention from the utterances, predict the next system action, and generate a proper system response for each turns in the conversation to attain the goal. </div>
